Support 1.7, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4.7 client on Spigot 1.8.8

FORK NOTES:
* THIS FORK MIGHT NEVER GET UPDATED AS I DON'T KNOW HOW TO CODE
* I GOT THIS FROM CLONING AND FORKING OLD COMMITS
* THIS MIGHT CAUSE A LOT OF BUGS
* THIS HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED IF IT WOULD WORK
* I AM NOT GOOD AT USING GITHUB SO I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ACCEPT PULL REQUESTS OR CHECK IF THEY WOULD WORK

Important notes:
* Only latest version of this plugin is supported
* This plugin can't be reloaded or loaded not at server startup
* This plugin doesn't work with netty native transport

Known issues:
* [Anything that is not latest] Items in creative mode may not work as expected, or may not work at all
* [1.6 and earlier] Stats are not sent - won't be fixed
* [1.5 and earlier] Can't control vehicle - won't be fixed, probably impossible to do this properly

Other possible issues:

* Thrown potion texture may be invalid for some clients
* Some clients that are higher than 1.5 might not be able to control vehicle
